# Single Page Application based on PHP Silex microframework 
It's built basic MVC design pattern. The frontend part of the application uses AJAX service implemented in vanilla JS.
The application utilizes the Yahoo Content Analysis API for purely development and educational purposes.

## Description:
This project is a very general Silex code sample. 

## Features:

+ Composer
+ Silex
+ Twitter Bootstrap (see http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)

## Installation notes:
Just extract the archive file and make use of it as it is structured. You would need to register on Yahoo Developer Network and get an API key. After you create a project in Yahoo Dev, you would need to set up your local settings (Apache or whatever your flavor web server is) to make possible use of this source code.

If you are not feeling like to manage all of those stuff, you just may try to use the ready "content-app.dev" project domain name, which I have been registered already. It was created only for the sake of that educational project. It is constrained to 5000 requests per day.
You will need to set up a "content-app.dev" virtual host in order to use the abovementioned registration.
